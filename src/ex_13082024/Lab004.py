#Take a user input of a,b,c and calculate the sum,mul,division and subtraction
#calculator program

a=int(input("Enter the value of a"))
b=int(input("Enter the value of b"))
c=int(input("Enter the value of c"))

#Calculate the sum
sum=a+b+c
print("Sum of a,b and c =",sum)

#Calculate the subtraction
minus=a-b-c
print("Substraction of a,b and c =",minus)

#Calculate the multiplication
Mul=a*b*c
print("Multiplication of a,b and c =",Mul)


#Calculate the division
Division=a/b/c
print("Division of a,b and c =",Division)
#division will give result in float as python is smart languag,it understand most of the result can give remainder
